	<p style="text-align:left;">The first round of free agency for the 2023 NFL offseason has now concluded. Over 150 players have found new homes in the NFL after a flurry of transfers from week to week. Cash is king, location matters, and state taxes are relevant in NFL free agency. Do you like to live in flip-flops and on the beach all year round in Miami or get up and shovel the driveway in Buffalo when it's only five degrees outside? In California, play in the sun? And keep in mind that when they reduce your signing bonus, those state taxes are no laughing matter. Where did every last penny go? Well then these factors become important. These are just a few of the issues that NFL players are thinking about as they get ready and will get ready to enter the free-agent market for future seasons. Yes, money always speaks, and we'll talk about it. What additional considerations do players take into account as they prepare to sign a new contract with a new team in a new city? The players' and their families' lives will be changed by this decision. The selecting procedure is thorough. This proposition must be analyzed from the viewpoint of an NFL player who is about to enter the free market. Therefore, it's critical to remember that the NFL is a business when you or a buddy is upset over one of their favorite players joining a rival team.  It's like college recruitment all over again, only with a lot more cash and opportunities to advance one's career.</p>

	<h2 style= "text-align: left";>Money talks </h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;">When a player leaves town for a better deal with his original club instead of staying in town for the big payday, it appears, well, fairly selfish from the outside. In the NFL, though, there is no such thing as loyalty. The front office is not trusted by players, and that won't ever change. NFL players can attempt to make as much money as they can during this time before being permanently let go, given the amount of players that are released every offseason (while still under contract). A bit less than three years are spent in the average NFL career. For the majority of free agents, this is the only opportunity they have to exert some influence because careers are brief, players sustain catastrophic injuries in the NFL, and those "prime years" create a small window of opportunity. This job is unlike any other because it entails great risk and big reward.</p>
		
			<body>

<h2 style= "text-align: left";>The reality of state taxes and location</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;">If the money and opportunity are somewhat equal on the market, we can expect free agents to jump at the chance to play in warmer weather or in cities that provide real entertainment off the field. The beach sells, and so do golf courses, 80-degree weather and nightlife.. The other top spots for free agents? Look at Atlanta, Dallas, New York or Houston (and now Los Angeles) -- cities with a lot to offer to young NFL players. But the reality comes back to financial reasoning. Every game that is played involves a player tax. It's not a flat fee or a government contract. As a result, the tax rates for home games and away games are different. And while choosing a team, free agents are aware of this. There are eight home games left where you can get a deal.</p>

	<br/>

<iframe title="2022 Total State Government Tax Collection per state" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-t2q6v" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/t2q6v/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="506" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

	<p style="text-align:left;">As a result, clubs from states without income taxes like the Cowboys, Texans, Jaguars, Buccaneers, Dolphins, Titans, Seahawks, and Raiders move up the list of contenders. That means more money in your pocket when the paycheck comes compared to California teams (13.3 percent state tax), the Jets and the Giants playing in Jersey (8.97 percent), the Bills in New York (8.82 percent) and even the Packers and that Wisconsin state tax (7.65 percent). But there's still more to think about when choosing where to play in free agency. It's time to pay up if you signed with the Niners, Chargers, or Rams. Every home game will reduce your take-home earnings. Even in the preseason game, the checks are seemingly  worthless. For NFL free agents, it's crucial to pick a team with a location that will maximize their financial potential.</p><

	<h2 style= "text-align: left";>Playing for a winner</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;">Everyone wants to win when they play, right? Chance to win a ring? Maybe. That story is occasionally fabricated. Older veterans, who have already earned some significant financial gains in the NFL, are affected by this, though. These are the seasoned veterans who may still have a few productive years ahead of them. They also want one more opportunity to compete for the Super Bowl championship on the postseason stage.The compensation most likely won't match what free agents who sign contracts on the first day receive. The majority of the money is spent there. Good players who enter the market are paid like Pro Bowlers due to the rising cap. But for veterans who take their time and are picky when choosing a new location, there is still some money remaining. And if they play their cards well, they might find themselves on a squad that has a real chance of contending in 2023 or later. There are no assurances in today's league when it comes to predicting a champion because of how evenly matched the NFL is. Veterans, however, will begin to focus on the Bengals, Chiefs, 49ers, and Patriots -- clubs with proven quarterbacks, coaching staffs, and key position players. That is crucial: Good starting points for veterans looking for a team that can compete seriously.</p>

	<h2 style= "text-align: left";>Recap of 2023 Off Season</h2>
	<p style="text-align:left;"> With these factors in mind, you now have to look back on this year's off season to see how players moved from teams. Denver Sports 103.4 radio host Mike Evans says, it all comes down to the best fit. 


<blockquote>
 <p style="text-align:left;"> "But I would say 80% of the choice just comes down to money. Which team offers the most money- the biggest contract? For us as sports fans we tend to think these athletes love to play the game and win. Most do. But for all of them it's a business and this is their career. And in a sport like football where the career expectancy isn't that long, any chance they have to "cash in," they're going to take it."</p>
</blockquote>

  <div class="column">
	<p style="text-align:left;"> And many players this offense season did just that. Former Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr made the move from the AFC to the NFC becoming a New Orlean Saint.  He signed a four-year contract worth a reported $150 million on March 6. The deal is said to include $70 million guaranteed, including $60 million at signing. Saints head coach Dennis Allen was the head coach of the Raiders when they drafted Carr in 2014 and the 31-year-old said Allen was a big reason why he opted to sign with New Orleans amid reported interest also from the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers. And while the Raiders lost their starting quarterback, it did not take too long for them to find their replacement. Former 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garapollo agreed to a three-year $67.5 million contract with $34 million guaranteed. Garoppolo played for the San Francisco 49ers for the past six seasons, taking the Niners to the Super Bowl in the 2019 season. On the defensive side, top free agent Javon Hargrave made the move to the west coast and signed a four-year, $81 million contract with the 49ers. Of that, $40 million is guaranteed at signing, including a $23 million signing bonus. And Jawaan Taylor, former offensive tackle for the Jacksonville Jaguars, is now a Kansas City Chief as the defending Super Bowl champion signed the 25-year-old signed a four-year, $80 million contract. So whether its the money, the location or the idea of becoming a Super Bowl champion, the NFL free agency process will always be the most interesting storyline in all of sports.
